Version 0.5.4
-------------

*released Thu, 14 Nov 2019*

Maintenance release:

- Switch build system to Python 3 by default (can be overridden if
  needed).
- Internal improvements for better cpychecker support.
- Fix compatibility with PyPy.
- Test improvements (both local and on Travis), testing more variations
  (debug, PyPy).
- Improve test coverage, and allow gathering test coverage results.
- Drop support (well, drop testing) for Python lower than 2.7.
- Minor documentation improvements (closes #9, #12).

Version 0.5.3
-------------

*released Thu, 30 Apr 2015*

FreeBSD fixes:

- Enable all FreeBSD versions after 7.x at level 2 (thanks to Garrett
  Cooper).
- Make test suite pass under FreeBSD, which has a stricter behaviour
  with regards to invalid ACLs (which we do exercise in the test suite),
  thanks again to Garret for the bug reports.

Version 0.5.2
-------------

*released Sat, 24 May 2014*

No visible changes release: just fix tests when running under pypy.

Version 0.5.1
-------------

*released Sun, 13 May 2012*

A bug-fix only release. Critical bugs (memory leaks and possible
segmentation faults) have been fixed thanks to Dave Malcolm and his
``cpychecker`` tool. Additionally, some compatibility issues with Python
3.x have been fixed (str() methods returning bytes).

The documentation has been improved and changed from epydoc to sphinx;
note however that the documentation is still auto-generated from the
docstrings.

Project reorganisation: the project home page has been moved from
SourceForge to GitHub.


Version 0.5
-----------

*released Sun, 27 Dec 2009*

Added support for Python 3.x and improved support for Unicode filenames.

Version 0.4
-----------

*released Sat, 28 Jun 2008*

License
~~~~~~~

Starting with this version, pylibacl is licensed under LGPL 2.1,
Febryary 1999 or any later versions (see README.rst and COPYING).

Linux support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few more Linux-specific functions:

- add the ACL.equiv_mode() method, which will return the equivalent
  octal mode if this is a basic ACL and raise an IOError exception
  otherwise

- add the acl_extended(...) function, which will check if an fd or path
  has an extended ACL

FreeBSD support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeBSD 7.x will have almost all the acl manipulation functions that
Linux has, with the exception of __getstate__/__setstate__. As a
workaround, use the str() and ACL(text=...) methods to pass around
textual representations.

Interface
~~~~~~~~~

At module level there are now a few constants exported for easy-checking
at runtime what features have been compiled in:

- HAS_ACL_FROM_MODE, denoting whether the ACL constructor supports the
  mode=0xxx parameter

- HAS_ACL_CHECK, denoting whether ACL instances support the check()
  method

- HAS_ACL_ENTRY, denoting whether ACL manipulation is possible and the
  Entry and Permset classes are available

- HAS_EXTENEDED_CHECK, denoting whether the acl_extended function is
  supported

- HAS_EQUIV_MODE, denoting whether ACL instances support the
  equiv_mode() method

Internals
~~~~~~~~~

Many functions have now unittests, which is a good thing.


Version 0.3
-----------

*released Sun, 21 Oct 2007*

Linux support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under Linux, implement more functions from libacl:

- add ACL(mode=...), implementing acl_from_mode
- add ACL().to_any_text, implementing acl_to_any_text
- add ACL comparison, using acl_cmp
- add ACL().check, which is a more descriptive function than validate

.. Local Variables:
.. mode: rst
.. fill-column: 72
