Requirements
------------

pylibacl has been written and tested on Linux, kernel v2.4 or newer,
with XFS filesystems; ext2/ext3 should also work. Since release 0.4.0,
FreeBSD 7 also has quite good support. If any other platform
implements the POSIX.1e draft, pylibacl can be used. I heard that
Solaris does, but I can't test it.

- Python 2.4 or newer
- operating system:
    - Linux, kernel v2.4 or newer, and the libacl library and
      development packages (all modern distributions should have this,
      under various names); also the file-systems you use must have
      ACLs turned on, either as a compile or mount option
    - FreeBSD 7.0 or newer
